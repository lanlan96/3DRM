## Introduction

3DRM is a plug-and-play module which can be applied to different 3D detection frameworks to detect 3D objects more accurately and robustly. We implement two applications on proposal-based methods and vote-based methods: OSegNet  (Proposal generation based on over-segmentation and backbones based on PointCNN) and VoteNet. OSegNet is trained and evaluated on S3DIS dataset, and VoteNet is trained and evaluated on ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D dataset.
